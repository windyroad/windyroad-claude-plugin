P087 Phase 3 — retroactive maturity rollout across all 11 `@windyroad/*` plugins. Each plugin's `plugin.json` now carries a populated `maturity:` field per top-level surface (skills, agents, hooks, commands) plus a `{schema_version, band}` rollup on the plugin root entry per ADR-063 §plugin.json field schema. Each plugin's README now carries a prose-woven rollup badge (`*Maturity: <Band>.*`) in the value-framing lead prose line per ADR-051 anti-pattern + ADR-063 §README badge rendering format.

Mechanical activation of Phase 3a (`wr-itil-plugin-maturity-populate`) and Phase 3b (`wr-itil-plugin-maturity-render`) against the live monorepo. Bootstrapping window active (suite-oldest surface 39 days shipped, less than 60-day threshold per ADR-053 §Bootstrapping clause); most surfaces land at Experimental with one Alpha bootstrapping surface (`wr-architect:agent` — meets the ≥100 invocations + ≥14 days criterion). Plugin root rollups all resolve to Experimental per the worst-case granularity contract (ADR-053 §granularity contract).

Drift detector (`wr-retrospective-check-plugin-maturity-drift`) reports 0 drift instances across all 12 packages — rendered badges match canonical records. Anti-pattern absence verified: no standalone `## Maturity` section, no shields.io URL, no compound bootstrapping rendering in per-skill cells (compound stays at rollup per ADR-063).

Closes the P087 Phase 3 retroactive mechanical rollout investigation task (P087 line 133). Activates the four Phase 3d JTBD outcome amendments shipped in P240: JTBD-302 maturity-band visibility, JTBD-007 maturity-band currency, JTBD-101 promotion-criteria visibility, JTBD-003 at-glance stability.
